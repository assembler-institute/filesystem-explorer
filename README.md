# PHP Local FileSystem explorer

The main objective of this project is to replicate a system file explorer that allows the user to navigate, create directories and upload files in the same way as he would in his usual operating system. In order to get access to the dashboard, users need to be authenticated. Each user can only navigate through his/her personal directory which is located in root.
