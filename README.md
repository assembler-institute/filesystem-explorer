# FileSystem Explorer

We have created a system file explorer that allows the user to navigate, create directories and upload files in the same way as he would in his usual operating system. The file explorer is a tool that allows you to directly view and manipulate the files and directories associated with a path, so you must take into account from which path the user starts and which path they can access.


## Actions users can do

* Create, modify and delete directories
* Browse through directories from an initial path
* The initial path will start from a folder inside the project repository whose name will be "root".
* Search directories and files by name
* In the case of searching for files by name, you must also be able to specify their extension as part of the name.
* Navigate through the initial path established and all the folders created from that path. Therefore the user will not be able to see or navigate to the parent folders of the “root” folder.
* Upload a file to a directory
* See information of files and directories
* Show the icon of the main file extensions.
* View the uploaded images.
* Play the uploaded videos.
* Play the uploaded audios.
