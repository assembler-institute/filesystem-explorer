</p>

> This current repository is the result of developing a Local FileSystem using PHP. With this application, you'll be able to navigate through all directories, upload files, editing their names, previewing and deleting them. Besides that, this application also offers you the option of editing file/directory names as well.

> Even though this is an already-working application, there are still some functionalities that can be implemented so keep an eye to this repo for more news!

## Requirements

- You cannot use file PHP third-party libraries
- You will not be able to use global variables in PHP.
- You must use GIT
- You must use the PHP v8
- Create a clear and orderly directory structure
- Both the code and the comments must be written in English
- Use the camelCase code style to define variables and functions
- In the case of using HTML, never use inline styles
- In the case of using different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãalways define the implementation in separate terms
- Remember that it is important to divide the tasks into several sub-tasks so that in this way you can associate each particular step of the construction with a specific commit
- You should try as much as possible that the commits and the planned tasks are the same
  Delete files that are not used or are not necessary to evaluate the project
